Healthcare Data Analysis Using R Studio

Exploring Patient Demographics and Test Results for Predictive Insights

Overview

This project explores a healthcare dataset using R Studio to analyze patient demographics and test results. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights that can inform predictive modeling and support healthcare decision-making.

Data Preparation & Cleaning
	•	Verified dataset integrity; no missing values were present.
	•	Structured demographic and test result variables for accurate analysis.

Analysis & Visualization
	•	Conducted descriptive statistics and generated histograms to examine age distribution and correlations with test results.
	•	Created a heatmap to visualize relationships among key health metrics.
	•	Developed pie charts summarizing the distribution of medical conditions across patients.

Tools Used
	•	R Studio for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
	•	Packages: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse

Interactive Outputs
	•	Compiled visualizations into an exploratory view to provide actionable insights.
	•	Visualizations highlight trends in demographics, test results, and medical condition distributions.

Key Takeaways
	•	Age distribution and test result correlations were identified.
	•	Relationships between health metrics were visualized to guide further predictive modeling.
	•	Demonstrates the application of R Studio for comprehensive exploratory data analysis in healthcare.
